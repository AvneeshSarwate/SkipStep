TASKS
- miniPage refactoring
- add transformation function application over subsets
- inspect/fix bug with refresh mode over grid sequencing 


* denotes new features
^ see footnote

OFFLINE MODE
     no longer a mini-page, it will be selected via a toggle on the right

STANDARD page
     same as now

RHYTHM page
       step jumper
       step synchronizer
       subset selector
       subset toggle 
       tap tempo (is universal if toggle not set
       * solo tap tempo toggle (subset tap tempo is opt-in)
       * tempo sync (will require backend modification to resync hit timings)
       * quick tempo change buttons (x2, x3, /2, /3 etc)        
       *^ "scale to fit" tempo change

GRID SEQUENCE Page
     same as now
     (maybe add algs stuff after resolving algs/gridseq)

ALGS page
     alg selector
     intensity selector
     auto apply toggle
     refresh toggle
     * subset selector
     * subset toggle
     * vertical subset (alg will only add new notes to selected rows)
	place it under row labels (they are see thru)
	place its toggle where the tap-tempo button is
     * vertical subset toggle
     movement arrows
     undo button
     grid load
     grid save
