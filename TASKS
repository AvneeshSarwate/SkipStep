TASKS
- test new UI refactor
- implement new features for which there is now UI
	transformation function application over subsets
	multi metronome
- miniPage refactoring (cleaning up names)
	match OSC address names to functions
	organize __init__() section handler assignment of functions on
		the same miniPage are adjacent 
- inspect/fix bug with refresh mode over grid sequencing 


* denotes new features
^ see footnote

OFFLINE MODE
     no longer a mini-page, it will be selected via a toggle on the right

STANDARD page
     same as now

RHYTHM page
       step jumper
       step synchronizer
       subset selector
       subset toggle 
       tap tempo (is universal if instrument selector not set)
       * tap-tempo/sync instrument selector (4 way toggle called /syncToggleInst)
       * sync toggle (toggles syncing for tempo, next hit time, loop position)
       * sync hit (applied the syncs chosen above)
       * loop sync (sets all loop indexes to 1 and syncs the hit on 1)
       * quick tempo change buttons (x2, x3, /2, /3 etc)        
       *^ "scale to fit" tempo change

GRID SEQUENCE Page
     same as now
     (maybe add algs stuff after resolving algs/gridseq)

ALGS page
     alg selector
     intensity selector
     auto apply toggle
     refresh toggle
     * subset selector
     * subset toggle
     * vertical subset (alg will only add new notes to selected rows)
	place it under row labels (they are see thru)
	place its toggle where the tap-tempo button is
     * vertical subset toggle
     movement arrows
     undo button
     grid load
     grid save
