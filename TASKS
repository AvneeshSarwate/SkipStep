TASKS
- finish implementing immediate-play stepjump - “TODO stepjump”
- BUG: when both double selectors on same index, one doesn’t update the other
- decide how tempoFit should work as a feature
	tempoFit will take the current instrument and adjust its tempo so the
	rhythm is the same duration as that of the target instrument. It will 
	then calculate the next hit of the current instrument s.t. it results
	in the first hits of the two loops occurring at the same time
- finish implementing tempoFit and test multi-metronome features 
	next-hit-sync not working, the rest besides tempoFit work 
- handle race conditions for tempo syncing
- refactoring (mainly cleaning up names)
	match OSC address names to functions
	specify what arguments come in via OSC and what is sent out via OSC
	organize __init__() section handler assignment of functions on
		the same miniPage are adjacent 
- inspect/fix bug/desing-flaw with refresh mode over grid sequencing 


* denotes new features
^ see footnote

OFFLINE MODE
     no longer a mini-page, it will be selected via a toggle on the right

STANDARD page
     same as now

RHYTHM page
       step jumper
       step synchronizer
       subset selector
       subset toggle 
       tap tempo (is universal if instrument selector not set)
       * tap-tempo/sync instrument selector (4 way toggle called /syncToggleInst)
       * sync toggle (toggles syncing for tempo, next hit time, loop position)
       * sync hit (applied the syncs chosen above)
       * loop sync (sets all loop indexes to 1 and syncs the hit on 1)
       * quick tempo change buttons (x2, x3, /2, /3 etc)        
       *^ "scale to fit" tempo change

GRID SEQUENCE Page
     same as now
     (maybe add algs stuff after resolving algs/gridseq)

ALGS page
     alg selector
     intensity selector
     auto apply toggle
     refresh toggle
     * subset selector
     * subset toggle
     * vertical subset (alg will only add new notes to selected rows)
	place it under row labels (they are see thru)
	place its toggle where the tap-tempo button is
     * vertical subset toggle
     movement arrows
     undo button
     grid load
     grid save


un done stuff marked in source as TODO stepjump
additional logic for immediate-play stepjump:
	first, separate realPlay into 2 functions:
		pre progInd increment/play - takes progInd, si, returns chord to play
		post - takes si, updates the gridStates[si] 

	create new playChord case in SuperCollider for stepjump case:
		turns notes on, and auto turns them off slightly before 
		the next metronome hit (allowing for articulation breaks) 
	
	create new endpoint in Supercollider that says whether a stepjump push
	is within the appropriate error range to set the “ignore hit” flag
	it will send the value back to python

	modify play chord to take stepjump flag 

   STEPJUMP
	call to supercollider function to see whether to set the “ignore hit” flag     

   STEPJUMP-FLAG-RETURN
	if jump was slightly before a metronome hit:
		set an “ignore hit” flag for the next hit
	set progInd to jumped index
	call pre function
	call playChord with stepjump flag
	increment progInd 
	call post function 
	
   HIT-EVENT
	if “ignore hit” flag set, 
		switch flag off
	else
		do normal realPlay logic
