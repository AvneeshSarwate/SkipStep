see supergridMultiDrafts for layout
(a different colored grid ("/seqgrid") is overlayed over normal grid (e.g. "/grid")

	[toggle 3][button]   (both red)
[toggle 1][munti toggle 1]   (all grey)
[toggle 2][multi toggle 2]

toggle 1 - edit toggle on/off
toggle 2 - grid sequencing on/off
toggle 3 - measure by measure grid sequence jumping on/off
button - clears saved sequence
multi toggle 1 - sequence tracker and indicator where grid will be added in edit mode
multi toggle 2 - will actually be a list of text boxes indicated what grid is there 
	(identified by its index in the "saved grids" selector element)
	

to edit a sequence: 
	turn on edit mode toggle
	move toggle 1 to place in sequence you want to set a grid
	press the pullup button of that grid 
	
text boxes show "-" if no grid, "b" if blank grid, index # otherwise

pressing grid pullup button when not in edit mode displays it on "/sequgrid"
	
clear button adds "blank" grid in edit mode

noise on during grid sequencing changes saved grids
	allow for saving of grid sets/sequences to bring back "original" sequence
	
unsaving makes that slot an "empty" grid, instead of skipping the space
	(solves problem of what to do when a grid in a sequence gets unsaved)
	alternative, a grid is not "unsaved" from a slot (and program memory) until the next grid is saved into it



save/load needs to include root note and subsets
