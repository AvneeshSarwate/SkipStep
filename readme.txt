basic looping mechanism working - start chuck, then python
chord/prog play properly with MIDI
python handles callbacks for grid correctly 
BASIC STEP SEQUENCER WORKS (maybe latency/timing issues regarding locks?)


Next steps
test stopping
test morph function



BUG (FIXED WITH MINIAUDICLE UPDATE) - 
after certain amount of loop iterations, 
playing a phrase no longer plays audio on ableton
even though ableton registers midi coming in, no audio.
restarting chuck VM temporarily fixes this. 
not sure if ableton or chuck problem.

basic grid "noise" function working
on every loop iteration, grid flips on average k squares.
