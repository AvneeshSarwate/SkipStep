basic looping mechanism working - start chuck, then python
chord/prog play properly with MIDI
python handles callbacks for grid correctly 
BASIC STEP SEQUENCER WORKS (maybe latency/timing issues regarding locks?)


Next steps
test stopping
test morph function



BUG (FIXED WITH MINIAUDICLE UPDATE) - 
after certain amount of loop iterations, 
playing a phrase no longer plays audio on ableton
even though ableton registers midi coming in, no audio.
restarting chuck VM temporarily fixes this. 
not sure if ableton or chuck problem. 

----------------------------------------------------

basic grid "noise" function working
on every loop iteration, grid flips on average k squares.

----------------------------------------------------
step indicator and "step jumping" working

noise on/off button, clear grid button working

added grid copy function

column subset looping working (with small bug)

modularity improvements (wrapper for cleanliness):
	create play(i) function - plays ith chord/column
	method to translate touchOSC indicies into grid indicies
	
for "column subset looping" - maintin list of selected column indicies
	iterate over that list (no need for new progression)

MORE FEATURES to implement
- back button
- reverse looping
----------------------------------------------
FIXED
- transition between normal and collumn subset looping
_________________________________________________

variable noise implemented

save/load grids implemented

BUGS
- still some issues with UI being thrown out of sync w/ internal grid
	double check threading
- when jumping between columns on collumn subset mode, doesn't exactly work right
- noise being applied on 14th column, not first
- optimize as much as possible 
-------
TODO:
- "refresh" mode-given a "backup" grid, you can change a column, and it plays 
	the changed version, but after the column is played it reverts to the backup version
	(levels of diff/backup? i.e. - refresh after 2 rounds, or 2 rounds variation, saving
	 each "round" of variation, then 2 rounds stepping back down 1 round at a time)
- piano mode:
	replace step position selectors with buttons
	create playOn and playOff code modeling phrase.play and LooperBackend
- comparison view - have one grid under another, bottom grid is same as current playing
	grid and uneditable, editable grid goes on top 
- optimize UI updating so OSC messages only sent for grid elements that are diff
	(precalculate diff grid: each element is -1 if same, or value of new grid if not)
--------
SHOULD PIANO GRID BE EDITABLE AND SHOULD CHANGES PUSH TO MAIN GRID
	option to toggle updating on/off?
	For now - "going to piano mode" sends main grid to piano screen
		but piano screen not pushed to main grid (can have button to do that)

writen, but with no UI and not tested: 
	refresh mode
	piano mode
