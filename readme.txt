basic looping mechanism working - start chuck, then python
chord/prog play properly with MIDI
python handles callbacks for grid correctly 
BASIC STEP SEQUENCER WORKS (maybe latency/timing issues regarding locks?)


Next steps
test stopping
test morph function



BUG - after certain amount of loop iterations, 
playing a phrase no longer plays audio on ableton
even though ableton registers midi coming in, no audio.
restarting chuck VM temporarily fixes this. 
not sure if ableton or chuck problem.
